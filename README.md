# TwitterRecycle

A Twitter/X xposed module. Long press on the main page X logo to open module settings.

The initial purpose of this module is to

1. filter retweets from followed users and
2. mark followed users with an emoji

because I need these features. Later other features are also implemented for convenience.

[TwiFucker](https://github.com/Dr-TSNG/TwiFucker) inspired this module.
Especially, it provides useful information about where to hook. Great thanks to this project.

The project is under GPLv3.
